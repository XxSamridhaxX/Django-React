after putting LOGIN.as_view() we should also put LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = 'login' in settings.py
that tells django about where to redirect after successful login.


API post:
The POST endpoint in our API allows authenticated users to create new Person entries. When a user sends a POST request to this endpoint, they must include data such as the person's name, email, and phone number in the request body, formatted as JSON. This data is captured using Django REST Framework's request.data object.

To process this incoming data, we use the PersonSerializer, which validates the input based on the rules defined in our model. For example, it checks whether all required fields are present and if the email is in a proper format. If the data passes validation, the serializer proceeds to save the new Person object to the database.

A crucial step here is associating the newly created Person with the currently logged-in user. We do this explicitly by passing user=request.user to the serializer.save() method. This ensures that every person record is linked to the user who created it, making it possible to later filter and retrieve data user-wise.

If the object is successfully created, the API responds with a JSON representation of the new person along with a 201 Created status code. However, if validation fails, it returns a clear explanation of what went wrong (like missing fields or invalid formats) with a 400 Bad Request status.

This setup allows users to manage their own directory of contacts while ensuring data integrity and secure user association in the backend.


day5:(6/9/2025) starting authtication token
add rest_framework and rest_framework.authtoken in installed app in settings.py
added this at the bottom of settings.py to enable token REST_FRAMEWORK = {

using postman for get first get token for corresponding user
then for get request use 
Authorization: Token 123dc54b17bc2122496e222130abcaf8248b18db

so till now we did manual getting of tokens right but how to make it automatic? Next this is our task
Today we'll do 3 things 
1: Automatically generate token 
2. create a login api view 
3. test token auth api with postman

2. create a login api view 
we create a token when we create a user first time but each time he logs in we are only interested in the users token so in order to implelemnt this we get this view function

aaba hamle euta custom_login() bhanne euta function banaunu parcha kinaki yo euta api ko end point huncha for login purpose ko lai like from end(react)
bata hamle login garna khojda simply login form use garera matra naya user banauna hudaina login form bhaneko session ko lai matra beneficiary huncha 
tra user lai ta hamle securely login garaunu parcha tesai le hamle token system use garcham harek time user le login garcha hamle tesko token regenerate(same token) dinu parcha.
HOW it works is that first time register garda token generate garera user lai dincha. user ko local db or browser ma store huncha
so arko choti login garda pheri pw dinu pardeina tei token le login garna milcha plus token compromize bhaye ni pw compromise hudeina so arko time tei token le use garcham
